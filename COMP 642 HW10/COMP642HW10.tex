1) \\ 
a) False. RNN can only access information from 1 previous time. \\

b) False. Does not consider any future input for the current state. However, the calculations does take into account historical information. \\

c) True. RNN are feedforward networks with a feedback loop and unrolled across time. Parameter sharing is necessary for efficiently processing sequential data. \\

d) False. Model size does not increase with size of input. The input is a vector and output is a attribute. \\

e) True. The input vector can be arbitrary in length. The input can't be so large that it causes computers to crash or something. \\
